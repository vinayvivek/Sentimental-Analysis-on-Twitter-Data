# Sentimental-Analysis-on-Twitter-Data
# Sentimental Analysis:
Sentimental Analysis is the most widely recognized classifcation tool that anlyzes an approaching message and tells whether the message is positive, negative or neutral. You can include a sentence of your decision and measure the conclusion.

In this repository we used twitter data as input and try to classify tweets into “positive” or “negative” sentiment by building a model based on probabilities.

# columns in the dataset
target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)                                                               
ids: The id of the tweet (2087)                                                                                                           
date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)                                                                                 
flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
